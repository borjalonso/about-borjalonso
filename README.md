👋 Hi, I'm @borjalonso

Nice to see you here. I want you to take a small but also faithful idea of who I am and how I code. Come on board!

I am a result-oriented Data Scientist 🧙 with almost 5 years' working experience in the analytical ecosystem.
Experienced in building Machine Learning models in order to predict real time behavior, my daily work involves me in the development of Artificial Intelligence algorithms,
clustering data for deeper understanding and implementing algorithms in pipelines.

I extensively worked with public and also private API's in Python and I even created my own ones. Participated in the management of NLP projects to get the most out of 
lexicon analysis and natural laguage processing, I helped companies develop cutting-edge and innovative projects in industries as diverse as cybersecurity, marketing, 
banking or insurance.

You see, what can be measured can also be improved 🎯

- 🌱 I’m currently doing research on new state-of-the-art algorithms
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on articles, github repositories and data sicence projects
